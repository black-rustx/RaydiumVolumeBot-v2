## üåü Features

- **Automated Distribution**: Efficiently distributes SOL across multiple wallets.
- **Endless Swaps: Performs** simultaneous buy and sell transactions seamlessly.
- **Optimized Performance**: Leverages Jito Bundle for transaction bundling and enhanced speed.
- **Market Impact**: Helps increase the token's market holders through active volume generation.
- **Powered by Solana**: Utilizes Solana‚Äôs high-speed, low-cost blockchain for optimal performance.
- Jito bundles for MEV protection
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## üõ† Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- A Solana wallet with SOL for transaction fees
- 0.01 SOL in wallet for swap

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/black-rustx/RaydiumVolumeBot-v2.git
   cd RaydiumVolumeBot-v2
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a .env file in the project root and add your Solana RPC URL and wallet private key:
   ```
   RPC_ENDPOINT=https://your-rpc-url-here
   PRIVATE_KEY=[your,private,keypair,array,here]
   ```
   We have included an example .env file in the repository for your convenience.

## üöÄ Usage

Run the script with:

```bash
npm start
```

This will execute a sample swap of 0.01 SOL to USDC. Modify the `main` function in `index.js` to customize the swap parameters. Ensure you have the correct token addresses and amounts for your swap in the wallet for the swap to execute.

## üíª Code Explanation

The `index.js` file contains the following key components:

1. **Setup and Imports**:

   - The script imports essential libraries and modules for interacting with Solana, including @solana/web3.js, @solana/spl-token, and custom utility functions from utils and executor modules.
   - Constants like RPC endpoints, intervals, and token mint details are imported from a constants file.

2. **Solana Connection and Main Wallet Initialization**:

   - **`solanaConnection`**: Establishes a connection to the Solana blockchain using an RPC endpoint with WebSocket support for real-time updates.
   - **`mainKp`**: Initializes the main wallet using a private key decoded from `base58`.

3. **Key Functions**:

   - **`distributeSol`**: Distributes SOL from the main wallet to multiple newly generated wallets, ensuring each has enough balance for subsequent operations.
   - **`buy`**: Executes buy transactions for tokens using Jupiter's aggregator for efficient swaps.Dynamically adjusts the buy amount based on wallet SOL balance and configured percentages (BUY_UPPER_PERCENT and BUY_LOWER_PERCENT). Utilizes Jito Bundle integration for optimized transaction execution when enabled.
   - **`sell`**: Sells tokens held in associated token accounts by leveraging Jupiter's swap functionality. Handles token balance checks and ensures the transaction is completed successfully.

4. **Wallet Transfer**:

   - Transfers remaining SOL to a newly generated wallet after each buy-and-sell cycle to reset the operation loop.

5. **Main Logic**:

   The main function orchestrates the entire bot process:

   - Prints bot settings, wallet balance, and other configurations..
   - Distributes SOL to sub-wallets for parallel operations
   - Executes an endless cycle of buying, selling, and redistributing SOL

6. **Optimization Features**:

   - **`Jito Bundle Integration`**: Enhances transaction bundling for improved efficiency and ensures optimal MEV protection.
   - **`Compute Budget Instructions`**: Adds compute unit limits and custom unit prices to transactions, improving performance on the Solana network.

7. **Error Handling and Logging**:

   - Comprehensive error handling ensures the bot continues or retries failed transactions without interrupting the workflow.
   - Logs detailed messages to track operations, including transaction links for monitoring on Solscan.

8. **Example Usage**:
   - Simply run the script to start the bot. It continuously performs buy-and-sell operations on the Raydium DEX and redistributes SOL across wallets, leveraging Solana's efficiency and Jupiter's aggregation.

## Transaction Simulation

To ensure accurate compute unit allocation, we simulate the transaction before sending it. This process:

1. Constructs a transaction with all necessary instructions.
2. Simulates the transaction using `connection.simulateTransaction()`.
3. Retrieves the actual compute units consumed.
4. Adds a 20% buffer to the consumed units for safety.

This approach helps prevent transaction failures due to insufficient compute budget.

## üèÜ Best Practices

This volume bot implements several best practices:

- **Versioned Transactions**: Utilizes the latest transaction format for improved efficiency.
- **Compute Budget Optimization**: Uses transaction simulation to set appropriate compute units.
- **Dynamic Priority Fees**: Implements adaptive priority fees based on recent network activity.
- **Address Lookup Tables**: Leverages ALTs to reduce transaction size and cost.
- **MEV Protection**: Integrates with Jito for protection against MEV (Miner Extractable Value).
- **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error catching and logging for easier debugging.
